# Plan — next steps

Open items only, in order. Remove an item when it is done. Each step ends with the check chain passing for the crates it touches, and a stop for review. Stage context: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); design: [design/](design/).

1. **Design and content**: the script API and the navigation design name what the release runs; the lane and 3v3 tests play with routes. Test: the workspace chain, and the LAN check.
2. **Vertical slice playtest, fourth round**: the same 1v1 on LAN, with routes and collision. Units that block each other and body block are new to the feel; write down whether the match reads and plays well. This closes stage 3, or names what is missing.
3. **Collision bench**: on a quiet machine, run `cargo bench -p campfire-capabilities --features bench --bench collision`: 1000 bodies, crowded into 40 m square and spread over 120 m square, contacts found and parted. Check that it fits the Collide stage's share of a tick at 30 Hz, and record the numbers beside the collision design. A timing probe on a busy machine gave 0.14 to 0.42 ms, against 2.1 to 2.5 ms for a check of every pair.
